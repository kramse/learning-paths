# Awesome list of networking resources for beginners

This list is intended for beginners in networking. You want to learn how the Internet works! The list is structured with a collection of easy to access sites, projects and books I recommend.

We focus on smaller resources, like shorter books which may not go through all protocols step by step. Hopefully this will make it easier to complete parts of this at your own pace, and keep you interested.

When you have learnt the basics of the internet protocols, addresses etc. you should be ready to take on more advanced resources.
